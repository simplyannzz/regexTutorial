## Regex Components

Regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/).

"Matching an email" Regex:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Comment: Javascript provides two ways to create a regex object. The first is shown in the example aboe, uses literal notation. The second is constructor. The constructor are not enclosed within slashes; instead they use quotation marks.
